### ⚙️ 1. **Elementor Website Builder** → ✅ **Required**

**👉 You must install this first.**
It’s the **core** page builder — the foundation that allows drag-and-drop editing.
Without it, the other two addons **won’t work**.

**✅ Install this first**

> 📦 Plugin: *Elementor Website Builder*
> Author: *Elementor Ltd.*
> Active Installs: 10M+

### 🧩 2. **Essential Addons for Elementor** → 💎 **Highly Recommended**

Once Elementor is installed, this plugin gives you **100+ extra widgets**:

* News Post Grid / Post Carousel
* Ticker, Tabs, Accordions
* Fancy Headers, Sliders, and Galleries
* Contact Form / Newsletter widgets

For a **news channel**, this addon gives you:

* 📰 Nice layouts for “Latest News”, “Trending”, “Top Categories”
* 🧠 Smart design blocks ready to import

**✅ Install this second.**

### 🎨 3. **Royal Elementor Addons and Templates** → ✳️ Optional (Good for Style Variety)

Also good — it provides **beautiful pre-built templates**, but many overlap with Essential Addons.
If you like experimenting with designs, you can use both, but start with **only one addon** to keep your site light and fast.

**🟡 Optional — install later if you want more style options.**

### ✅ RECOMMENDED COMBO for News Site

| Purpose                          | Plugin                             |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Main Page Builder                | **Elementor Website Builder**      |
| Extra Widgets for News Layouts   | **Essential Addons for Elementor** |
| (Optional) More Design Templates | Royal Elementor Addons             |

---

Once both are active, you can:

* Go to **Pages → Add New → Edit with Elementor**
* Start building your **Home page layout** using “Post Grid” or “Post Carousel” widgets.
